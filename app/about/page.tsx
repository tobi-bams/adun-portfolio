            Currently, I work as a video editor at FrameForge Studios, where I
            help brands, creators, and startups craft stories that feel sharp,
            intentional, and unforgettable.
            <p>
              Previously, I worked as a senior video editor at VisionCraft
              Media, where I led post-production for campaigns viewed by
              millions. On the side, I'm building CutLab, a tool that helps
              editors and creative teams streamline their editing workflow and
              collaborate with more clarity. Before CutLab, I cofounded
              ReelSync, a lightweight web app that lets creators organize their
              footage, share selects, and get timestamped feedback without
              friction.
            </p>{" "}
            <p>
              Before ReelSync, I spent 2 years leading the editorial team at
              Studio Nine, shaping how production houses approach narrative,
              color, pacing, and sound design across long-form and short-form
              content. In 2024, I worked on the early edit direction for
              FocusFlow (Alpha) at Collective Studios in London, helping define
              the video aesthetic and story arc for the product's launch.
              FocusFlow was later re-edited to create a more distilled,
              cinematic experience that helped users feel immersed and
              motivated.
            </p>{" "}
            As a storyteller with a deep love for pacing, emotion, and rhythm, I
            enjoy bringing ideas to life with other creative people. And when
            I'm not editing, refining cuts, building tools, or directing
            post-production workflows, you'll probably find me watching YouTube
            videos about filmmaking, design, color theory, and creative
            excellence.
